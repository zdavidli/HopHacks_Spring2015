Idea

1. *Dropbox – auto-compress unused files
  
  a. If the file is relatively old, compress it
  
  b. If the file is very old, delete it (keep it on cloud)
  
  c. Limit it to certain folders (in Dropbox especially)
  
  d. maybe send usage emails about what’s changed
  
  e. maybe have different settings by device (Delete files more aggressively
