# StashBox

Anyone with who has used an electronic device knows what it feels like to be bogged down by photos. StashBox can let you keep these memories safe and off your device, allowing more storage space. It will improve disk usage as a whole.

Our target user is anyone who uses a computer, because the limitations of physical storage space affect everyone. A StashBox user chooses a set of directories that StashBox acts on. In these directories, if a file's last access time is a certain length of time, the file will be compressed to take up less space. If it's an even longer time, the user has the option to delete the file and upload it to Dropbox, so that the photo will be preserved on the cloud but will not take up local storage space.

Created using Python 2.7 and GUi using Tkinter.
